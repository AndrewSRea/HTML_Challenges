        <h1>The island of Kaua'i</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Kaua'i</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Kah-wau-ee", <em>with a sharp staccato accent where the apostrophe lies</em>)
            is geologically the second-oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands (after <a href="niihau.html">Niʻihau</a>). With an area of 
            562.3 square miles (1,456.4 km<sup>2</sup>), it is the fourth-largest of the islands and the 21st largest island in the 
            United States. Known also as the "Garden Isle", Kauaʻi lies 105 miles (169 km) across the Kauaʻi Channel, northwest of 
            <a href="oahu.html">Oʻahu</a>. This island is the site of Waimea Canyon State Park, which is known as the "Grand Canyon of 
            the Pacific", a large canyon approximately ten miles (16 km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western 
            side of Kauaʻi.

        <h2>History of Kaua'i</h2>
        <p>
            In 1778, Captain James Cook arrived at Waimea Bay, the first European known to have reached the Hawaiian islands. He named 
            the archipelago the "Sandwich Isles" after his patron, the 6th Earl of Sandwich, George Montagu. During the reign of King 
            Kamehameha, the islands of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau were the last Hawaiian Islands to join his Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. Their ruler, 
            Kaumualiʻi, resisted Kamehameha for years. King Kamehameha twice prepared a huge armada of ships and canoes to take the 
            islands by force, and twice failed; once due to a storm, and once due to an epidemic. In the face of the threat of a further 
            invasion, however, Kaumualiʻi decided to join the kingdom without bloodshed, and became Kamehameha's vassal in 1810. He ceded 
            the island to the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi upon his death in 1824.

        <h2>Geography of Kaua'i</h2>
        <p>
            Kauaʻi's origins are volcanic, the island having been formed by the passage of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot. 
            At approximately five million years old, it is the oldest of the main islands.[12] The highest peak on this mountainous 
            island is Kawaikini at 5,243 feet (1,598 m).
        </p>
        <p>
            The second highest peak is Mount Waiʻaleʻale near the center of the island, 5,148 ft (1,569 m) above sea level. One of the 
            wettest spots on earth, with an annual average rainfall of 460 inches (38.3 ft; 11.7 m), is located on the east side of 
            Mount Waiʻaleʻale. The high annual rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains, carving out canyons with many 
            scenic waterfalls. On the west side of the island, Waimea town is located at the mouth of the Waimea River, whose flow formed 
            Waimea Canyon, one of the world's most scenic canyons, which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park. At three thousand feet (910 m) 
            deep, Waimea Canyon is often referred to as "The Grand Canyon of the Pacific". Kokeo Point lies on the south side of the island. 
            The Na Pali Coast is a center for recreation in a wild setting, including kayaking past the beaches, or hiking on the trail along 
            the coastal cliffs. The headland, Kuahonu Point, is on the south-east of the island.

        <h2>Places of interest in Kaua'i</h2>
        <p>
            Kauaʻi is home to thousands of moa (wild chickens) who have few natural predators, as the mongoose was never introduced in 
            Kauaʻi as it has been on other Hawaiian islands. Kauaʻi's chickens originated from the original Polynesian settlers, who 
            brought them as a food source. They have since bred with European chickens that have gotten free from farms and cockfighting 
            breeders.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Kauaʻi Heritage Center of Hawaiʻian Culture and the Arts was founded in 1998. Their mission is to nurture a greater 
            sense of appreciation and respect for the Hawaiʻian culture. They offer classes in Hawaiʻian language, hula, lei and cordage 
            making, the lunar calendar and chanting, plus trips to cultural sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kauaʻi is home to many shave ice shops, a tradition in the islands. Popular tourist shave ice shops are Wailua Shave Ice 
            in the town of Kapaʻa, and Uncleʻs Shave Ice in the towns of Lihuʻe and Koloa.
