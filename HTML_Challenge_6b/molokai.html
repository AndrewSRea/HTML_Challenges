        <h1>The island of Moloka'i</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Moloka'i</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Moh-loh-ka-ee", <em>with a sharp staccato accent where the apostrophe lies</em>)
            is the fifth most populated of the eight major islands that make up the Hawaiian Islands archipelago in the middle of the 
            Pacific Ocean. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of 260 
            square miles (673.40 km<sup>2</sup>), making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island 
            in the United States. It lies east of <a href="oahu.html">Oʻahu</a> across the 25 miles (40 km) wide Kaʻiwi Channel and 
            north of <a href="lanai.html">Lānaʻi</a>, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel.

        <p>
            The island is known under several names by the local population: Molokaʻi ʻĀina Momona (land of abundance), Molokaʻi Pule 
            Oʻo (powerful prayer), and Molokaʻi Nui A Hina (of the goddess Hina). Both the form Molokai (without an ʻokina) and Molokaʻi 
            (with) have long been used by native speakers of Hawaiian, and there is debate as to which is the original form, with 
            conflicting claims as to which the elders used. The USGS uses the form with the ʻokina.
        </p>
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
            Molokaʻi developed from two distinct shield volcanoes known as East Molokaʻi and the much smaller West Molokaʻi. The highest 
            point is Kamakou on East Molokaʻi, at 4,970 feet (1,510 m). Today, East Molokaʻi volcano, like the Koʻolau Range on Oʻahu, 
            is what remains of the southern half of the original mountain. The northern half suffered a catastrophic collapse about 1.5 
            million years ago and now lies as a debris field scattered northward across the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. What remains of 
            the volcano on the island include the highest sea cliffs in the world. The south shore of Molokaʻi boasts the longest 
            fringing reef in the U.S. at 25 miles (40 km) long.
        </p>
        <p>
            Molokaʻi is part of the state of Hawaiʻi and located in Maui County, Hawaiʻi, except for the Kalaupapa Peninsula, which is 
            separately administered as Kalawao County. Maui County encompasses Maui, Lānaʻi, and Kahoʻolawe in addition to Molokaʻi. 
            The largest town on the island is Kaunakakai, which is one of two small ports on the island. Molokaʻi Airport is located 
            on the central plains of Molokaʻi.
        </p>
        <h2>History of Moloka'i</h2>
        <p>
            It used to be thought that Molokaʻi was first settled around AD 650 by indigenous peoples most likely from the Marquesas 
            Islands. However, a 2010 study using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples has 
            established that the period of eastern Polynesian colonization of the Marquesas Islands took place much later, in a shorter 
            time frame of two waves: the "earliest in the Society Islands c. 1025–1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; 
            then after 70–265 years, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands c. 1190–1290." Later migrants likely 
            came from Tahiti and other south Pacific islands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Captain James Cook recorded sighting Molokaʻi in 1778, the first European sailor to visit the island was Captain 
            George Dixon of the British Royal Navy in 1786. The first significant European influence came in 1832 when a Protestant 
            mission was established at Kaluaʻaha on the East End of the island by Reverend Harvey Hitchcock. The first farmer on 
            Molokaʻi to grow, produce and mill sugar and coffee commercially was Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer, an immigrant from Germany who 
            arrived in 1850. He built the first and only sugar mill on the island in 1878, which is now a museum.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ranching began on Molokaʻi in the first half of the 19th century when King Kamehameha V set up a country estate on the 
            island, which was managed by Meyer and became what is now the Molokai Ranch. In the late 1800s, Kamehameha V built 
            a vacation home in Kaunakakai and ordered the planting of over 1,000 coconut trees in Kapuaiwa Coconut Grove.

        <h3>The leper colony on Moloka'i</h3>
        <p>
            Leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) was among Eurasian diseases introduced to the Hawaiian islands by traders, sailors, 
            workers and others who lived in societies where these diseases were endemic. Because of the islanders' lack of immunity to 
            the new diseases, they suffered high rates of infection and death from smallpox, cholera and whooping cough, as well as 
            leprosy. Sugar planters were worried about the effects on their labor force and pressured the government to take action to 
            control the spread of leprosy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legislature passed a control act requiring quarantine of people with leprosy. The government established Kalawao located 
            on the isolated Kalaupapa peninsula on the northern side of Molokaʻi, followed by Kalaupapa as the sites of a leper colony 
            that operated from 1866 to 1969. Because Kalaupapa had a better climate and sea access, it developed as the main community. 
            A research hospital was developed at Kalawao. The population of these settlements reached a peak of 1100 shortly after the 
            beginning of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
            In total over the decades, more than 8500 men, women and children living throughout the Hawaiian islands and diagnosed with 
            leprosy were exiled to the colony by the Hawaiian government and legally declared dead. This public health measure was 
            continued after the Kingdom became a U.S. territory. Patients were not allowed to leave the settlement nor have visitors and 
            had to live out their days here. In 1969 the century-old laws of forced quarantine were abolished. Former patients living in 
            Kalaupapa today have chosen to remain here, most for the rest of their lives. In the 21st century, there are no persons 
            on the island with active cases of leprosy, which has been controlled through medication, but some former patients chose to 
            continue to live in the settlement after its official closure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Arthur Albert St. Mouritz served as a physician to the leper settlement from 1884 to 1887. He explained how leprosy 
            was spread. Pater Damiaan de Veuster, a Flemish priest of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary served 
            as a missionary for 16 years in the communities of sufferers of leprosy. Joseph Dutton, who served in the 13th Wisconsin 
            Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1883, came to Molokaʻi in 
            1886 to help Pater Damiaan and the rest of the population who suffered from leprosy. Pater Damiaan died at Kalaupapa in 1889 
            while Joseph Dutton died in Honolulu in 1931 at the age of 87. Mother Marianne Cope of the Sisters of Saint Francis of 
            Syracuse, New York, brought six of her Sisters to work in Hawaiʻi with leprosy sufferers in the late 19th century, also 
            serving on Molokaʻi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both Father Damiaan and Mother Marianne have been canonized as Saints by the Roman Catholic Church for their charitable 
            work and devotion to sufferers of leprosy. In December 2015, the cause of Joseph Dutton was formally opened, obtaining 
            him the title Servant of God.
