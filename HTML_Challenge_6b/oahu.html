        <h1>The island of O'ahu</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>O'ahu</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Oh-wa-hoo", <em>with a sharp staccato accent where the apostrophe lies</em>),
            also known as "The Gathering Place", is the third-largest of the Hawaiian Islands. It is home to roughly one million people--about 
            two-thirds of the population of the U.S. state of Hawaii. The island lies within Honolulu County and the state capital, 
            Honolulu, is on O'ahu's southeast coast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Including small associated islands such as Ford Island plus those in Kāneʻohe Bay and off the eastern (windward) coast, its 
            area is 596.7 square miles (1,545.4 km<sup>2</sup>), making it the 20th-largest island in the United States.

            Oahu is 44 miles (71 km) long and 30 miles (48 km) across. Its shoreline is 227 miles (365 km) long. The island is composed 
            of two separate shield volcanoes: the Waiʻanae and Koʻolau Ranges, with a broad valley or saddle (the central Oahu Plain) 
            between them. The highest point is Kaʻala in the Waiʻanae Range, rising to 4,003 feet (1,220 m) above sea level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city of Honolulu--O'ahu's largest city, state capital, and main deepwater marine port for the State of Hawaiʻi--is 
            located here. As a jurisdictional unit, the entire island of Oahu is in the Honolulu County, although as a place name, 
            Honolulu occupies only a portion of the southeast end of the island.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the entire island is officially the City and County of Honolulu, locals identify settlements using town names 
            (generally those of the census-designated places), and consider the island to be divided into various areas, which may 
            overlap. The most commonly accepted areas are the "City", "Town" or "Town side", which is the urbanized area from Halawa 
            to the area below Diamond Head (residents of the island north of the Koʻolau Mountains consider the Town Side to be the 
            entire southern half), "West Oahu", which goes from Pearl Harbor to Kapolei, ʻEwa and may include the Mākaha and Waiʻanae 
            areas; the "North Shore" (northwestern coast); the "Windward Side" (northeastern coast from Kahuku to Kāneʻohe); the "East 
            Side" or "East Coast" (the eastern portion of the island, from Kāneʻohe on the northeast, around the tip of the island to 
            include much of the area east of Diamond Head); and "The Valley" or "Central Oahu" which runs northwest from Pearl Harbor 
            toward Haleʻiwa. These terms are somewhat flexible, depending on the area in which the user lives, and are used in a mostly 
            general way, but residents of each area identify strongly with their part of the island, especially those outside of widely-known 
            towns. For instance, if locals are asked where they live, they would usually reply "Windward Oahu" rather than "Laie".
        </p>
        <p>
            Being roughly diamond-shaped, surrounded by ocean and divided by mountain ranges, directions on Oahu are not generally 
            described with the compass directions found throughout the world. Locals instead use directions originally using Honolulu 
            as the central point. To go ʻewa means traveling toward the western tip of the island, "Diamond Head" is toward the eastern 
            tip, mauka is inland (toward the central Koʻolau Mountain range, north of Honolulu) and makai toward the sea. When these 
            directions became common, Diamond Head was the eastern edge of the primary populated area. Today, with a much larger populace 
            and extensive development, the mountain itself is often not actually to the east when directions are given, and is not to be 
            used as a literal point of reference—to go "Diamond Head" is to go to the east from anywhere on the island.
        </p>

            Oahu is also known for having the longest rain shower in history, which lasted for 200 consecutive days. Kāneʻohe Ranch 
            reported 247 straight days with rain from August 27, 1993 to April 30, 1994. The island has many nicknames one of them 
            being "rainbow state." This is because rainbows are a common sight in Hawaiʻi due to the frequent rain showers. The average 
            temperature in Oahu is around 70–85 °F (21–29 °C) and the island is the warmest in June through October. The weather during 
            the winter is cooler, but still warm with an average temperature of 68–78 °F (20–26 °C).
        </p>
        <p>
            The windward side is known for some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Lanikai Beach on the windward coast of Oahu 
            has been consistently ranked among the best beaches in the world.

        <h2>History of O'ahu</h2>
        <p>
            The island has been inhabited since at least 3rd century A.D. The 304-year-old Kingdom of Oʻahu was once ruled by the most 
            ancient aliʻi in all of the Hawaiian Islands. The first great king of Oʻahu was Maʻilikūkahi, the lawmaker, who was followed 
            by many generation of monarchs. Kualiʻi was the first of the warlike kings and so were his sons. In 1773, the throne fell 
            upon Kahahana, the son of Elani of Ewa. In 1783, Kahekili II, King of Maui, conquered Oʻahu and deposed the reigning family 
            and then made his son, Kalanikūpule, king of O'ahu, turning O'ahu into a puppet state. Kamehameha the Great would conquer in 
            the mountain Kalanikūpule's force in the Battle of Nuʻuanu. Kamehameha founded the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi with the conquest of 
            Oʻahu in 1795. Hawaiʻi would not be unified until the islands of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau surrendered under King Kaumualiʻi in 
            1810. Kamehameha III moved his capital from Lāhainā, Maui to Honolulu, Oʻahu in 1845. ʻIolani Palace, built later by other 
            members of the royal family, is still standing, and is the only royal palace on American soil.

            Oahu was apparently the first of the Hawaiian Islands sighted by the crew of HMS Resolution on January 19, 1778, during 
            Captain James Cook's third Pacific expedition. Escorted by HMS Discovery, the expedition was surprised to find high islands 
            this far north in the central Pacific. Oahu was not actually visited by Europeans until February 28, 1779, when Captain 
            Charles Clerke aboard HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay. Clerke had taken command of the ship after James Cook 
            was killed at Kealakekua Bay (island of Hawaiʻi) on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific. With 
            the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands came the introduction of disease, mosquitoes, and aggressive foreign animals. Although 
            indirect, the simple exposure to these foreign species caused permanent damage to the Native Hawaiian people and environment.

            The Imperial Japanese Navy's attack on Pearl Harbor, Oahu on the morning of December 7, 1941 brought the United States into 
            World War II. The surprise attack was aimed at destroying the American will to fight and make them sue for peace immediately 
            by attacking the Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Forces and Marine Air Forces. The attack 
            damaged or destroyed twelve American warships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and resulted in the deaths of 2,335 American servicemen 
            and 68 civilians (of those, 1,177 were the result of the destruction of the USS Arizona alone).
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Oahu has become a tourism and shopping haven. Over five million visitors (mainly from the contiguous United States 
            and Japan) flock there every year to enjoy the island.
