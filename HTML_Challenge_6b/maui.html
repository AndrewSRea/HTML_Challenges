        <h1>The island of Maui</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Maui</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Mow [like "wow"]-wee") is the second-largest of the Hawaiian Islands at 
            727.2 square miles (1,883 km<sup>2</sup>) and is the 17th largest island in the United States. Maui is part of the 
            State of Hawaii and is the largest of Maui County's four islands, which include <a href="molokai.html">Molokaʻi</a>, 
            <a href="lanai.html">Lānaʻi</a>, and unpopulated <a href="kahoolawe.html">Kahoʻolawe</a>. In 2010, Maui had a population 
            of 144,444, third-highest of the Hawaiian Islands, behind that of <a href="oahu.html">Oʻahu</a> and <a href="hawaii.html">
            Hawaiʻi Island</a>. Kahului is the largest census-designated place (CDP) on the island with a population of 26,337 as of 
            2010, and is the commercial and financial hub of the island. Wailuku is the seat of Maui County and is the third-largest 
            CDP as of 2010. Other significant places include <em>Kīhei</em> (including Wailea and Makena in the Kihei Town CDP, the 
            island's second-most-populated CDP), <em>Lāhainā</em> (including Kāʻanapali and Kapalua in the Lāhainā Town CDP), 
            <em>Makawao</em>, <em>Pukalani</em>, <em>Pāʻia</em>, <em>Kula</em>, <em>Haʻikū</em>, and <em>Hāna</em>.

        <h2>Derivation of the name Maui</h2>
        <p>
            Native Hawaiian tradition gives the origin of the island's name in the legend of <em>Hawaiʻiloa</em>, the navigator 
            credited with discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. According to it, <em>Hawaiʻiloa</em> named the island after his son, 
            who in turn was named for the demigod <em>Māui</em>. The earlier name of Maui was <em>ʻIhikapalaumaewa</em>. The Island 
            of Maui is also called the "Valley Isle" for the large isthmus separating its northwestern and southeastern volcanic masses.
        </p>
        <h2>Geology and topography</h2>
        <p>
            Maui's diverse landscapes are the result of a unique combination of geology, topography, and climate. Each volcanic cone 
            in the chain of the Hawaiian Islands is built of dark, iron-rich/quartz-poor rocks, which poured out of thousands of vents 
            as highly fluid lava over a period of millions of years. Several of the volcanoes were close enough to each other that lava 
            flows on their flanks overlapped one another, merging into a single island. Maui is such a "volcanic doublet," formed from 
            two shield volcanoes that overlapped one another to form an isthmus between them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The older, western volcano has been eroded considerably and is cut by numerous drainages, forming the peaks of the West Maui 
            Mountains (in Hawaiian, Mauna Kahalawai). Puʻu Kukui is the highest of the peaks at 5,788 feet (1,764 m). The larger, younger 
            volcano to the east, Haleakalā, rises to more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above sea level, and measures 5 miles (8.0 km) from 
            seafloor to summit. The eastern flanks of both volcanoes are cut by deeply incised valleys and steep-sided ravines that run 
            downslope to the rocky, windswept shoreline. The valley-like Isthmus of Maui that separates the two volcanic masses was 
            formed by sandy erosional deposits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maui's last eruption (originating in Haleakalā's Southwest Rift Zone) occurred around 1790; two of the resulting lava flows 
            are located (1) at Cape Kīnaʻu between ʻĀhihi Bay and La Perouse Bay on the southwest shore of East Maui, and (2) at 
            Makaluapuna Point on Honokahua Bay on the northwest shore of West Maui. Considered to be dormant by volcanologists, 
            Haleakalā is certainly capable of further eruptions.

            Maui is part of a much larger unit, Maui Nui, that includes the islands of Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Molokaʻi, and the now 
            submerged Penguin Bank. During periods of reduced sea level, including as recently as 20,000 years ago, they are joined 
            together as a single island due to the shallowness of the channels between them.
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>
            The climate of the Hawaiian Islands is characterized by a two-season year, tropical and uniform temperatures everywhere 
            (except at high elevations), marked geographic differences in rainfall, high relative humidity, extensive cloud formations 
            (except on the driest coasts and at high elevations), and dominant trade-wind flow (especially at elevations below a few 
            thousand feet). Maui itself has a wide range of climatic conditions and weather patterns that are influenced by several 
            different factors in the physical environment:
            <ul>
                <li>Half of Maui is situated within 5 miles (8.0 km) of the island's coastline. This, and the extreme insularity of 
                    the Hawaiian Islands account for the strong marine influence on Maui's climate.</li>
                <li>Gross weather patterns are typically determined by elevation and orientation towards the Trade winds (prevailing 
                    air flow comes from the northeast).</li>
                <li>Maui's rugged, irregular topography produces marked variations in conditions. Air swept inland on the trade winds 
                    is shunted one way or another by the mountains, valleys, and vast open slopes. This complex three-dimensional flow 
                    of air results in striking variations in wind speed, cloud formation, and rainfall.</li>
            </ul>
            Maui displays a unique and diverse set of climatic conditions, each of which is specific to a loosely defined sub-region 
            of the island. These sub-regions are defined by major physiographic features (such as mountains and valleys) and by location 
            on the windward or leeward side of the island.
        </p>
        <h4>Subregions</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Windward lowlands</span> -- Below 2,000 feet (610 m) on north-to-northeast sides of an island. Roughly 
                    perpendicular to direction of prevailing trade winds. Moderately rainy; frequent trade wind-induced showers. 
                    Skies are often cloudy to partly cloudy. Air temperatures are more uniform (and mild) than those of other 
                    regions.</li>
                <li><span>Leeward lowlands</span> -- Daytime temperatures are a little higher and nighttime temperatures are lower 
                    than in windward locations. Dry weather is prevalent, with the exception of sporadic showers that drift over the 
                    mountains to windward and during short-duration storms.</li>
                <li><span>Interior lowlands</span> -- Intermediate conditions, often sharing characteristics of other lowland 
                    sub-regions. Occasionally experience intense local afternoon showers from well-developed clouds that formed due 
                    to local daytime heating.</li>
                <li><span>Leeward side high-altitude mountain slopes</span> -- Extensive cloud cover and rainfall all year long. 
                    Mild temperatures are prevalent, but humidity is higher than any other sub-region.</li>
                <li><span>Leeward side lower mountain slopes</span> -- Rainfall is higher than on the adjacent leeward lowlands 
                    but much less than at similar altitudes on the windward side; however, maximum rainfall usually occurs leeward 
                    of the crests of lower mountains. Temperatures are higher than on the rainy slopes of the windward sides of 
                    mountains; cloud cover is almost as extensive.</li>
                <li><span>High mountains</span> -- Above about 5,000 feet (1,500 m) on Haleakalā, rainfall decreases rapidly with 
                    elevation. Relative humidity may be ten percent or less. The lowest temperatures in the state are experienced 
                    in this region: air temperatures below freezing are common.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>History of Maui</h2>
        <p>
            Polynesians from Tahiti were the original people to populate Maui. The Tahitians introduced the kapu system, a strict 
            social order that affected all aspects of life and became the core of Hawaiʻian culture. Modern Hawaiʻian history began 
            in the mid-18th century. Kamehameha I, king of the island of Hawaiʻi, invaded Maui in 1790 and fought the inconclusive 
            Battle of Kepaniwai, but returned to Hawaiʻi to battle a rival, finally subduing Maui a few years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            On November 26, 1778, explorer James Cook became the first European to see Maui. Cook never set foot on the island because 
            he was unable to find a suitable landing. The first European to visit Maui was the French admiral Jean-François de Galaup, 
            comte de Lapérouse, who landed on the shores of what is now known as La Perouse Bay on May 29, 1786. More Europeans followed: 
            traders, whalers, loggers (e.g., of sandalwood) and missionaries. The latter began to arrive from New England in 1823, 
            settling in Lahaina, which at that time was the capital. They clothed the natives, banned them from dancing hula, and greatly 
            altered the culture. The missionaries taught reading and writing, created the 12-letter Hawaiian alphabet, started a printing 
            press in Lahaina, and began writing the islands' history, which until then was transmitted orally. Ironically, the 
            missionaries both altered and preserved the native culture. The religious work altered the culture while the literacy efforts 
            preserved native history and language. Missionaries started the first school in Lahaina, which still exists today: 
            Lahainaluna Mission School, which opened in 1831.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the height of the whaling era (1843–1860), Lahaina was a major center. In one season over 400 ships visited with up to 
            100 anchored at one time in Lāhainā Roads. Ships tended to stay for weeks rather than days, fostering extended drinking 
            and the rise of prostitution, against which the missionaries vainly battled. Whaling declined steeply at the end of the 
            19th century as petroleum replaced whale oil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kamehameha's descendants reigned until 1872. They were followed by rulers from another ancient family of chiefs, including 
            Queen Liliʻuokalani, deposed in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii by American business interests. One year later, 
            the Republic of Hawaii was founded. The island was annexed by the United States in 1898 and made a territory in 1900. Hawaiʻi 
            became the 50th U.S. state in 1959.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1937, Vibora Luviminda trade union conducted the last strike action of an ethnic nature in the Hawaiʻian Islands against 
            four Maui sugarcane plantations, demanding higher wages and the dismissal of five foremen. Manuel Fagel and nine other strike 
            leaders were arrested, and charged with kidnapping a worker. Fagel spent four months in jail while the strike continued. 
            Eventually, Vibora Luviminda made its point and the workers won a 15% increase in wages after 85 days on strike, but there 
            was no written contract signed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maui was centrally involved in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a staging center, training base, and rest and 
            relaxation site. At the peak in 1943-44, more than 100,000 soldiers were there. The main base of the 4th Marine Division 
            was in Haiku. Beaches were used to practice landings and train in marine demolition and sabotage.
