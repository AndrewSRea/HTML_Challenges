        <h1>The island of Maui</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Maui</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Mow [like "wow"]-wee") is the second-largest of the Hawaiian Islands at 
            727.2 square miles (1,883 km<sup>2</sup>) and is the 17th largest island in the United States. Maui is part of the 
            State of Hawaii and is the largest of Maui County's four islands, which include <a href="molokai.html">Molokaʻi</a>, 
            <a href="lanai.html">Lānaʻi</a>, and unpopulated <a href="kahoolawe.html">Kahoʻolawe</a>. In 2010, Maui had a population 
            of 144,444, third-highest of the Hawaiian Islands, behind that of <a href="oahu.html">Oʻahu</a> and <a href="hawaii.html">
            Hawaiʻi Island</a>. Kahului is the largest census-designated place (CDP) on the island with a population of 26,337 as of 
            2010, and is the commercial and financial hub of the island. Wailuku is the seat of Maui County and is the third-largest 
            CDP as of 2010. Other significant places include <em>Kīhei</em> (including Wailea and Makena in the Kihei Town CDP, the 
            island's second-most-populated CDP), <em>Lāhainā</em> (including Kāʻanapali and Kapalua in the Lāhainā Town CDP), 
            <em>Makawao</em>, <em>Pukalani</em>, <em>Pāʻia</em>, <em>Kula</em>, <em>Haʻikū</em>, and <em>Hāna</em>.

        <h2>Derivation of the name Maui</h2>
        <p>
            Native Hawaiian tradition gives the origin of the island's name in the legend of <em>Hawaiʻiloa</em>, the navigator 
            credited with discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. According to it, <em>Hawaiʻiloa</em> named the island after his son, 
            who in turn was named for the demigod <em>Māui</em>. The earlier name of Maui was <em>ʻIhikapalaumaewa</em>. The Island 
            of Maui is also called the "Valley Isle" for the large isthmus separating its northwestern and southeastern volcanic masses.
        </p>
        <h2>Geology and topography</h2>
        <p>
            Maui's diverse landscapes are the result of a unique combination of geology, topography, and climate. Each volcanic cone 
            in the chain of the Hawaiian Islands is built of dark, iron-rich/quartz-poor rocks, which poured out of thousands of vents 
            as highly fluid lava over a period of millions of years. Several of the volcanoes were close enough to each other that lava 
            flows on their flanks overlapped one another, merging into a single island. Maui is such a "volcanic doublet," formed from 
            two shield volcanoes that overlapped one another to form an isthmus between them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The older, western volcano has been eroded considerably and is cut by numerous drainages, forming the peaks of the West Maui 
            Mountains (in Hawaiian, Mauna Kahalawai). Puʻu Kukui is the highest of the peaks at 5,788 feet (1,764 m). The larger, younger 
            volcano to the east, Haleakalā, rises to more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above sea level, and measures 5 miles (8.0 km) from 
            seafloor to summit. The eastern flanks of both volcanoes are cut by deeply incised valleys and steep-sided ravines that run 
            downslope to the rocky, windswept shoreline. The valley-like Isthmus of Maui that separates the two volcanic masses was 
            formed by sandy erosional deposits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maui's last eruption (originating in Haleakalā's Southwest Rift Zone) occurred around 1790; two of the resulting lava flows 
            are located (1) at Cape Kīnaʻu between ʻĀhihi Bay and La Perouse Bay on the southwest shore of East Maui, and (2) at 
            Makaluapuna Point on Honokahua Bay on the northwest shore of West Maui. Considered to be dormant by volcanologists, 
            Haleakalā is certainly capable of further eruptions.

        <p>
            Maui is part of a much larger unit, Maui Nui, that includes the islands of Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Molokaʻi, and the now 
            submerged Penguin Bank. During periods of reduced sea level, including as recently as 20,000 years ago, they are joined 
            together as a single island due to the shallowness of the channels between them.
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>
            The climate of the Hawaiian Islands is characterized by a two-season year, tropical and uniform temperatures everywhere 
            (except at high elevations), marked geographic differences in rainfall, high relative humidity, extensive cloud formations 
            (except on the driest coasts and at high elevations), and dominant trade-wind flow (especially at elevations below a few 
            thousand feet). Maui itself has a wide range of climatic conditions and weather patterns that are influenced by several 
            different factors in the physical environment:
            <ul>
                <li>Half of Maui is situated within 5 miles (8.0 km) of the island's coastline. This, and the extreme insularity of 
                    the Hawaiian Islands account for the strong marine influence on Maui's climate.</li>
                <li>Gross weather patterns are typically determined by elevation and orientation towards the Trade winds (prevailing 
                    air flow comes from the northeast).</li>
                <li>Maui's rugged, irregular topography produces marked variations in conditions. Air swept inland on the trade winds 
                    is shunted one way or another by the mountains, valleys, and vast open slopes. This complex three-dimensional flow 
                    of air results in striking variations in wind speed, cloud formation, and rainfall.</li>
            </ul>
            Maui displays a unique and diverse set of climatic conditions, each of which is specific to a loosely defined sub-region 
            of the island. These sub-regions are defined by major physiographic features (such as mountains and valleys) and by location 
            on the windward or leeward side of the island.
