        <h1>The island of Lanai</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Lanai</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Lah-nai") is the sixth-largest of the Hawaiian Islands and the smallest 
            publicly accessible inhabited island in the chain. It is colloquially known as the "Pineapple Island" because of its 
            past as an island-wide pineapple plantation. The island's only settlement of note is the small town of Lanai City. 
            As of 2012, the island was 98% owned by Larry Ellison (founder and chairman of computer technology corporation Oracle), 
            with the remaining 2% owned by the state of Hawaii and privately owned homes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lanai is a roughly apostrophe-shaped island with a width of 18 miles (29 km) in the longest direction. The land area is 
            140.5 square miles (364 km<sup>2</sup>), making it the 42nd largest island in the United States. It is separated from 
            the island of <a href="molokai.html">Molokaʻi</a> by the Kalohi Channel to the north, and from Maui by the Auʻau Channel 
            to the east. The United States Census Bureau defines Lanai as Census Tract 316 of Maui County. Its total population shrank 
            from 3,193 as of the 2000 census to 3,131 as of 2010. Many of the island's landmarks are accessible only by dirt roads that 
            require a four-wheel drive vehicle.

            There is one school, Lanai High and Elementary School, serving the entire island from kindergarten through 12th grade. 
            There is also one hospital, Lanai Community Hospital, with 24 beds, and a community health center providing primary care, 
            dental, behavioral health and selected specialty services in Lanai City. There are no traffic lights on the island.

        <h2>History of Lanai</h2>
        <p>
            Lanai was under the control of nearby <a href="maui.html">Maui</a> before recorded history. Its first inhabitants may have 
            arrived as late as the 15th century. The Hawaiian-language name <em>Lānaʻi</em> is of uncertain origin, but the island has 
            historically been called <em>Lānaʻi o Kauluāʻau</em>, which can be rendered in English as "day of the conquest of Kauluāʻau." 
            This epithet refers to the legend of a Mauian prince who was banished to Lanai for some of his wild pranks at his father's 
            court in Lāhainā. The island was reportedly haunted by Akua-ino, ghosts and goblins. Kauluāʻau chased them away and brought 
            peace and order to the island and regained his father's favor as a consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first people to migrate here, most likely from Maui and Molokaʻi, probably established fishing villages along the coast 
            initially but later branched out into the interior where they raised taro in the fertile volcanic soil. During most of those 
            times, the Mōʻī of Maui held dominion over Lanai, but generally left the people of Lanai alone. Life on Lanai remained 
            relatively calm until King Kamehameha I or Kalaniʻōpuʻu-a-Kaiamamao took control, slaughtering people across the island. So 
            many were killed that Captain George Vancouver ignored the island in 1792, because of its apparent lack of villages and 
            population. It is mentioned that Lanai was Kamehameha's favorite fishing spot across Hawaii's main eight islands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lanai was first seen by Europeans on February 25, 1779, when Captain Charles Clerke sighted the island from aboard James 
            Cook's HMS Resolution. Clerke had taken command of the ship after Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14 and was 
            leaving the islands for the North Pacific.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history of sugar-growing in Hawaii goes back to 1802, when a farmer from China, Wong Tse Chun, produced a small amount 
            on Lanai. He used a crude stone mill that he had brought with him to crush the cane.

            In 1854 a group of Mormons were granted a lease in the ahupuaʻa of Pālāwai. In 1862 Walter M. Gibson arrived on Lānaʻi to 
            reorganize the Mormon settlement. A year later he bought the ahupuaʻa of Pālāwai for $3000 with the money of the church 
            but put the title in his own name. When the Mormons found this out they excommunicated him but he still got to retain the 
            land. By the 1870s, Walter M. Gibson, still the leader of the Mormon colony on the island, had acquired most of the land 
            on the island for ranching.

            By 1890 the population of Lānaʻi was reduced to 200. In 1899, Gibson's daughter and son-in-law formed Maunalei Sugar 
            Company, headquartered in Keomuku, on the windward (northeast) coast downstream from Maunalei Valley. The company failed 
            in 1901. Between 1899 and 1901, however, nearly 800 laborers, mostly from Japan, had been contracted for the plantations. 
            Many Native Hawaiians continued to live along the less arid windward coast, supporting themselves by ranching and fishing.

            In 1921, Charles Gay planted the first pineapple on Lanai. The population had again decreased to 150, most of whom were 
            the descendants of the traditional families of the island. A year later, James Dole, the president of Hawaiian Pineapple 
            Company (later renamed Dole Food Company), bought the island and developed a large portion of it into the world's largest 
            pineapple plantation. With Hawaii statehood in 1959, Lanai became part of the County of Maui. In 1985, Lanai passed into 
            the control of David H. Murdock, as a result of his purchase of Castle & Cooke, then owner of Dole. In October 1992 the 
            final harvest of pineapple took place on Lanai.

            In June 2012, Larry Ellison, then CEO of Oracle Corporation, purchased Castle & Cooke's 98 percent share of the island for 
            $300 million. The state and individual homeowners own the remaining 2 percent, which includes the harbor and the private 
            homes where the 3,000 inhabitants live. Ellison, who believes renewable energy must be cost-competitive with fossil fuels 
            in order to be viable, stated intentions to invest as much as $500 million to improve the island's infrastructure and 
            create an environmentally-friendly agricultural industry. As of 2016, Ellison had spent an estimated $450 million to remodel 
            his Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay, which reopened in April 2016 after a seven-month shutdown. In Lanai City he 
            built a new water filtration system and a resort-style Olympic-size public pool. He also refurbished the historic movie 
            theater built in the 1920s but mostly shut since the 1970s, turning it into a state-of-the art movie house. His second 
            Four Seasons Resort at Kōʻele in the mountains is currently being renovated. Ellison has also started a solar-powered 
            hydroponic farming venture, Sensei, which has two 20,000 square foot computer-monitored greenhouses and plans to build four 
            more.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of February 10, 2020, Ellison is in negotiations to purchase the diesel-powered utility assets of the island in order 
            to build out a sustainable ecosystem powered by solar power and batteries. However it was reported in May 2020 that 
            while plans to transition from using fossil fuels to renewable resources continue the talks by Ellison's company to acquire 
            the utility had ended.

        <h2>Lore of Lanai</h2>
        <p>
            According to the Hawaiian legends, man-eating spirits occupied the island. For generations, Maui chiefs believed in these 
            man-eating spirits. Differing legends say that either the prophet Lanikāula drove the spirits from the island or the unruly 
            Maui prince Kauluāʻau accomplished that heroic feat. The more popular myth is that the mischievous Kauluāʻau pulled up every 
            breadfruit tree (<em>ʻulu</em>) he could find on Maui. Finally his father, Kakaʻalaneo had to banish him to Lanai, expecting 
            him not to survive in that hostile place. However, Kauluāʻau outwitted the spirits and drove them from the island. The chief 
            looked across the channel from Maui and saw that his son's fire continued to burn nightly on the shore, and he sent a canoe 
            to Lanai to bring the prince back, redeemed by his courage and cleverness. As a reward, Kakaʻalaneo gave Kauluāʻau control 
            of the island and encouraged emigration from other islands. Kauluāʻau had, in the meantime, pulled up all the breadfruit 
            trees on Lanai, accounting for the historic lack of them on that island.
