        <h1>The island of Kaho'olawe</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Kaho'olawe</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Ka-ho-oh-lah-wei", <em>with a sharp staccato accent where the apostrophe 
            lies</em>) is the smallest of the eight main volcanic islands in the Hawaiian Islands. Kahoʻolawe is located about seven 
            miles (11 km) southwest of <a href="maui.html">Maui</a> and also southeast of <a href="lanai.html">Lānaʻi</a>, and it is 
            11 mi (18 km) long by 6.0 mi (9.7 km) wide, with a total land area of 44.97 sq mi (116.47 km<sup>2</sup>). The highest 
            point on Kahoʻolawe is the crater of <em>Lua Makika</em> at the summit of <em>Puʻu Moaulanui</em>, which is about 1,477 
            feet (450 m) above sea level. Kahoʻolawe is relatively dry (average annual rainfall is less than 65 cm or 26 in) because 
            the island's low elevation fails to generate much orographic precipitation from the northeastern trade winds, and Kahoʻolawe 
            is located in the rain shadow of eastern Maui's 10,023-foot-high (3,055 m) volcano, <em>Haleakalā</em>. More than one quarter 
            of Kahoʻolawe has been eroded down to saprolitic hardpan soil, largely on exposed surfaces near the summit.

            Kahoʻolawe has always been sparsely populated, due to its lack of fresh water. During World War II, Kahoʻolawe was used 
            as a training ground and bombing range by the Armed Forces of the United States. After decades of protests, the U.S. Navy 
            ended live-fire training exercises on Kahoʻolawe in 1990, and the whole island was transferred to the jurisdiction of the 
            state of Hawaii in 1994. The Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve to restore and to oversee 
            the island and its surrounding waters. Today Kahoʻolawe can be used only for native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and 
            subsistence purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>History of Kaho'olawe</h2>
        <h3>Settlement</h3>
        <p>
            Sometime around the year 1000, Kahoʻolawe was settled by Polynesians, and small, temporary fishing communities were 
            established along the coast. Some inland areas were cultivated. Puʻu Moiwi, a remnant cinder cone, is the location 
            of the second-largest basalt quarry in Hawaiʻi, and this was mined for use in stone tools such as <em>koʻi</em> 
            (<em>adzes</em>). Originally a dry forest environment with intermittent streams, the land changed to an open savanna 
            of grassland and trees when inhabitants cleared vegetation for firewood and agriculture. Hawaiians built stone platforms 
            for religious ceremonies, set rocks upright as shrines for successful fishing trips, and carved petroglyphs, or drawings, 
            into the flat surfaces of rocks. These indicators of an earlier time can still be found on Kahoʻolawe. While it is not 
            known how many people inhabited Kahoʻolawe, the lack of freshwater probably limited the population to a few hundred people. 
            As many as 120 people might have once lived at Hakioawa, the largest settlement, which was located at the northeastern end 
            of the island—facing Maui.
        </p>
        <h3>Warfare</h3>
        <p>
            Violent wars among competing aliʻi (chiefs) laid waste to the land and led to a decline in the population. During the 18th 
            century War of Kamokuhi, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, the ruler of the Big Island of Hawaii, raided and pillaged Kahoʻolawe in an 
            unsuccessful attempt to take Maui from Kahekili II, the King of Maui.
        </p>
        <h3>Post-contact</h3>
        <p>
            From 1778 to the early 19th century, observers on passing ships reported that Kahoʻolawe was uninhabited and barren, 
            destitute of both water and wood. After the arrival of missionaries from New England, the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi under the 
            rule of King Kamehameha III replaced the death penalty with exile, and Kahoʻolawe became a men's penal colony sometime 
            around 1830. Food and water were scarce, some prisoners reportedly starved, and some of them swam across the channel to 
            Maui to find food. The law making the island a penal colony was repealed in 1853.

            A survey of Kahoʻolawe in 1857 reported about 50 residents here, about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) of land covered with 
            shrubs, and a patch of sugarcane growth. Along the shore, tobacco, pineapple, gourds, pili grass, and scrub trees grew. 
            Beginning in 1858, the Hawaiian government leased Kahoʻolawe to a series of ranching ventures. Some of these proved to 
            be more successful than others, but the lack of freshwater was an unrelenting hindrance. Through the next 80 years, the 
            landscape changed dramatically, with drought and uncontrolled overgrazing denuding much of the island. Strong trade winds 
            blew away most of the topsoil, leaving behind red hardpan dirt.
        </p>
        <h3>20th Century</h3>
        <p>
            From 1910 to 1918, the Territory of Hawaii designated Kahoʻolawe as a forest reserve in the hope of restoring the island 
            through a revegetation and livestock removal program. This program failed, and leases again became available. In 1918, 
            the rancher Angus MacPhee of Wyoming, with the help of the landowner Harry Baldwin of Maui, leased the island for 21 years, 
            intending to build a cattle ranch there. By 1932, the ranching operation was enjoying moderate success. After heavy rains, 
            native grasses and flowering plants would sprout, but droughts always returned. In 1941, MacPhee subletted part of the island 
            to the U.S. Army. Later that year, because of continuing drought, MacPhee removed his cattle from the island.
        </p>
        <h3>Kaho'olawe Island Archeological District</h3>
        <p>
            On March 18, 1981, the entire island of Kahoʻolawe was added to the National Register of Historic Places. At that time, 
            the Kahoʻolawe Archaeological District was noted to contain 544 recorded archaeological or historic sites and over 2,000 
            individual features. As part of the soil conservation efforts, Mike Ruppe, an Army Specialist on loan from Schofield 
            Barracks, plus other military personnel, laid lines of explosives, detonating them to break the hardpan so that seedling 
            trees could be planted. Used car tires were taken to Kahoʻolawe and placed in miles of deep gullies to slow the washing of 
            red soil from the barren uplands to the surrounding shores. Ordnance and scrap metal was picked up by hand and then 
            transported by large trucks to a collection site.
        </p>
        <h3>Kaho'olawe Island Reserve</h3>
        <p>
            In 1993, the Hawaiian State Legislature established the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve, consisting of "the entire island and 
            its surrounding ocean waters in a two mile (three km) radius from the shore". By state law, Kahoʻolawe and its waters 
            can be used only for Native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes; fishing; environmental restoration; 
            historic preservation; and education. All commercial uses are prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legislature also created the Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission to manage the reserve while it is held in trust 
            for a future Native Hawaiian sovereign entity. The restoration of Kahoʻolawe will require a strategy to control 
            erosion, re-establish vegetation, recharge the water table, and gradually replace alien plants with native species. 
            Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. In some areas, non-native plants will 
            temporarily stabilize soils before planting of permanent native species. Species used for revegetation include 
            <em>ʻaʻaliʻi</em> (<em>Dodonaea viscosa</em>), <em>ʻāheahea</em> (<em>Chenopodium oahuense</em>), <em>kuluʻī</em> 
            (<em>Nototrichium sandwicense</em>), <em>Achyranthes splendens</em>, <em>ʻūlei</em> (<em>Osteomeles anthyllidifolia</em>), 
            <em>kāmanomano</em> (<em>Cenchrus agrimonioides var. agrimonioides</em>), <em>koaiʻa</em> (<em>Acacia koaia</em>), and 
            <em>alaheʻe</em> (<em>Psydrax odorata</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
            In July 2015, a Business Plan for the Restoration of Hawaiian Bird Life and Native Ecosystems on Kaho‘olawe was proposed 
            in partnership with KIRC, Island Conservation, DLNR, The Nature Conservancy, Protect Kaho‘olawe ‘Ohana, HDOA, American 
            Bird Conservancy, and USFWS. The plan outlines the restoration of Kaho‘olawe Island through the removal of feral cats 
            (<em>Felis catus</em>), rats (<em>Rattus exulans</em>) and mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>). The document investigates and 
            addresses the biological, cultural, financial, and regulatory implications associated with the eradication.
