        <h1>The island of Hawai'i</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Hawai'i</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "Ha-wai-ee", <em>with a sharp staccato accent where the apostrophe lies</em>) 
            is the largest island located in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is the largest and the southeasternmost of the Hawaiian Islands, 
            a chain of volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean. With an area of 4,028 square miles (10,430 km<sup>2</sup>), it has 63% 
            of the Hawaiian archipelago's combined landmass, and is the largest island in the United States. However, it has only 13% of 
            Hawaiʻi's people. The island of Hawaiʻi is the third largest island in Polynesia, behind the two main islands of New Zealand. 
            The island is often referred to as the Island of Hawaiʻi, the "Big Island", or Hawaiʻi Island to distinguish it from the 
            state. Administratively, the whole island encompasses Hawaiʻi County.

        <h2>History of Hawai'i</h2>
        <p>
            Hawaiʻi is said to have been named after <em>Hawaiʻiloa</em>, the legendary Polynesian navigator who first discovered it. 
            Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of <em>Hawaiki</em>, a place from which some Polynesian people 
            are said to have originated, the place where they transition to in the afterlife, or the realm of the gods and goddesses. 
            Captain James Cook, the English explorer and navigator who was captain of the first European expedition that came upon the 
            Hawaiian Islands, called it <em>O-Why-hee</em> (from Hawaiian) and the "<em>Sandwich Islands</em>" after his patron, the 
            Earl of Sandwich. Cook was killed on the Big Island at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779, in a mêlée which followed the 
            theft of a ship's boat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hawaiʻi was the home island of <em>Paiʻea Kamehameha</em>, later known as Kamehameha the Great. Kamehameha united most of 
            the Hawaiian islands under his rule in 1795, after several years of war, and gave the kingdom and the island chain the name 
            of his native island. In 1822 the missionary William Ellis arrived and was one of a party that completed a tour of the island, 
            descriptions of which were later published in his journal.
        </p>
        <h2>Geology and geography</h2>
        <p>
            According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 5,086 square miles (13,170 km<sup>2</sup>), of which 
            4,028 square miles (10,430 km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 1,058 square miles (2,740 km<sup>2</sup>) (20.8%) is water. The 
            county's land area comprises 62.7 percent of the state's land area. It is the highest percentage by any county in the 
            United States. At its greatest dimension, the island is 93 miles (150 km) across. It has a land area of 4,028 square miles 
            (10,430 km<sup>2</sup>) comprising 62% of the Hawaiian Islands' land area. Measured from its sea floor base to its highest 
            peak, <em>Mauna Kea</em> is the world's tallest mountain, taller than even Mount Everest, since the base of Mount Everest 
            is above sea level. <em>Ka Lae</em>, the southernmost point in the 50 states of the United States, is on Hawaii. The nearest 
            landfall to the south is in the Line Islands. To the northwest of the island of Hawaii is the island of <a href="maui.html">Maui</a>, 
            whose <em>Haleakalā</em> volcano is visible from Hawaiʻi across the <em>Alenuihaha Channel</em>.
        </p>
        <h3>Volcanism</h3>
        <p>
            The island of Hawaiʻi is built from five separate shield volcanoes that erupted somewhat sequentially, one overlapping the 
            other. These are (from oldest to youngest):

        <ul>
            <li><span>Kohala</span> -- extinct</li>
            <li><span>Mauna Kea</span> -- dormant</li>
            <li><span>Hualālai</span> -- dormant</li>
            <li><span>Mauna Loa</span> -- active, partially within <em>Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park</em></li>
            <li><span>Kīlauea</span> -- active: erupting continuously from 1983 to 2018; part of <em>Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Geological evidence from exposures of old surfaces on the south and west flanks of Mauna Loa led to the proposal that two 
            ancient volcanic shields (named <em>Ninole</em> and <em>Kulani</em>) were all but buried by the younger Mauna Loa. 
            Geologists now consider these "outcrops" to be part of the earlier building of Mauna Loa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because Mauna Loa and Kīlauea are active volcanoes, the island of Hawaii is still growing. Between January 1983 and September 
            2002, lava flows added 543 acres (220 ha) to the island. Lava flowing from Kīlauea has destroyed several towns, including 
            Kapoho in 1960, and Kalapana and Kaimū in 1990. In 1987 lava filled in "Queen's Bath", a large, L-shaped, freshwater pool in 
            the Kalapana area. Another 875 acres were added between May to July, 2018 by the 2018 lower Puna eruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some geologists count seven volcanoes as building the island, which include the submarine volcanoes Māhukona and Lōʻihi as 
            parts of the base of the island. Māhukona off the northwest corner of the island has already disappeared below the 
            surface of the ocean. Approximately 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Hawaii lies the undersea volcano known as Lōʻihi. It 
            is an erupting seamount that now reaches approximately 3,200 feet (980 m) below the surface of the ocean. Continued activity 
            at current rates from Lōʻihi will likely cause it to break the surface of the ocean sometime between 10,000 and 100,000 years 
            from now.
        </p>
        <h3>Great Crack</h3>
        <p>
            The Great Crack is an eight-mile-long (13,000 m), 60-foot-wide (18 m) and 60-foot-deep (18 m) fissure in the island, in the 
            district of Kau. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Great Crack is the result of crustal dilation 
            from magmatic intrusions into the southwest rift zone of Kilauea.[22] While neither the earthquake of 1868 nor that of 1975 
            caused a measurable change in the Great Crack, lava welled out of the lower 6 miles (10 km) of the Great Crack in 1823.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visitors can find trails, rock walls, and archaeological sites from as old as the 12th century around the Great Crack. In 
            August 2018, the National Park Service purchased nearly 2,000 acres (810 ha) of private land adjacent to Hawaii Volcanoes 
            National Park, claiming that the area has important geological features that need to be studied and preserved.

        <h3>Hilina Slump</h3>
        <p>
            The Hilina Slump is a 4,760-cubic-mile (19,800 km<sup>3</sup>) section of the south slope of the Kīlauea volcano which is 
            slipping away from the island. Between 1990 and 1993, Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements showed a southward 
            displacement of about 4 inches (10 cm) per year.[24] Undersea measurements show that a "bench" has formed a buttress and 
            that this buttress may tend to reduce the likelihood of future catastrophic detachment.
        </p>
        <h3>Earthquakes and tsunamis</h3>
        <p>
            On 2 April 1868, an earthquake with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.9 rocked the southeast coast of Hawaiʻi. 
            This was the most destructive earthquake in the recorded history of Hawaiʻi.[27] It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa, 
            5 miles (8 km) north of Pahala, killing 31 people. A tsunami claimed 46 more lives. The villages of Punaluʻu, Nīnole, 
            Kawaʻa, Honuʻapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged. The tsunami reportedly rolled over the tops of the coconut 
            trees up to 60 feet (18 m) high, and it reached inland a distance of a quarter of a mile (400 meters) in some places.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 29 November 1975, a 37-mile-wide (60 km) section of the Hilina Slump dropped 11.5 feet (3.5 m) and slid 26 feet (7.9 m) 
            toward the ocean. This movement caused a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and a 48-foot-high (15 m) tsunami. Oceanfront property 
            was washed off its foundations in Punaluu. Two deaths were reported at Halape, and 19 other people were injured.
        </p>
        <p>
            The island suffered tsunami damage from earthquakes in Alaska on 1 April 1946, and in Chile on 23 May 1960. Downtown Hilo 
            was severely damaged by both tsunamis, with many lives lost. Just north of Hilo, Laupāhoehoe lost 16 schoolchildren and 
            five teachers in the tsunami of 1946.
        </p>
        <p>
            In March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the east coast of Japan again created a tsunami that caused minor damage 
            in Hawaiʻi. The estimated damage to public buildings alone was about US$3 million. In the Kona area this tsunami washed 
            a house into Kealakekua Bay, destroyed a yacht club and tour boat offices in Keauhou Bay, caused extensive damage in 
            Kailua Kona, flooded the ground floor of the King Kamehameha Hotel, and permanently closed the Kona Village Resort.
        </p>
        <p>
            In early May 2018, hundreds of small earthquakes were detected on Kīlauea's East rift zone, leading officials to issue 
            evacuation warnings. On 3 May 2018, the volcano erupted in Puna after a 5.0 earthquake earlier in the day, causing 
            evacuations of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions. A seemingly related 5.3 magnitude quake and a 
            subsequent 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred on 4 May.
        </p>
        <h3>Volcanic fog</h3>
        <p>
            "Vog" (volcanic fog) can envelop the island of Hawaiʻi when Kilauea Volcano is active. Since the termination of volcanic 
            activity in September 2018, the vog has largely disappeared on the west side of the island. The gas plumes of the 
            Kīlauea Volcano create a blanket of vog which the dominant trade winds mostly deflect toward the Kona coast on the west 
            side of the island of Hawaiʻi. Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment and the health of plants, humans, 
            and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage them and 
            impair function. Flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are reported, and are especially pronounced in people with 
            respiratory conditions.
