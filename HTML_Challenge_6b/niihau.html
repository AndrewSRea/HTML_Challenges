        <h1>The island of Ni'ihau</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Ni'ihau</strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "nee-ee-how"<em>, with a sharp staccato accent between the two "i's"</em>)
            is the westernmost main and seventh largest inhabited island in Hawai'i. It is 17.5 miles (28.2 km) southwest of Kauaʻi 
            across the Kaulakahi Channel. Its area is only 69.5 square miles (180 km<sup>2</sup>). The island is about 6 million 
            years old, making it geologically older than the 5.8-million-year-old neighboring island of Kauaʻi to the northeast.
            Niʻihau is the remnant of the southwestern slope of what was once a much larger volcano. The entire summit and other 
            slopes collapsed into the ocean in a giant prehistoric landslide.

            The island, known as "the Forbidden Isle", is off-limits to all but the Robinson family and their relatives, U.S. Navy 
            personnel, government officials, and invited guests. The Robinson family are descendants of Elizabeth Sinclair, who lived
            from April 26, 1800, to October 16, 1892, and was a Scottish homemaker, farmer, and plantation owner in New Zealand and 
            Hawai'i, who bought the island of Ni'ihau in 1864. The Robinson family continues to own and maintain the island of Ni'ihau.

            From 1987 onwards, a limited number of supervised activity tours and hunting safaris have opened to tourists. The people of 
            Niʻihau are noted for their gemlike lei pūpū (shell lei) craftsmanship. They speak Hawaiian as a primary language.

        <h2>History of Ni'ihau</h2>
        <p>
            Prior to the unification of the Kingdom of Hawaii under Kamehameha I, Niʻihau was ruled by the aliʻi. Kahelelani was the 
            first of the Niʻihau aliʻi. His name is now used to refer to the Niʻihau kahelelani, the puka shell of the wart turbans 
            (<em>Leptothyra verruca</em>), used to make exquisite Niʻihau shell jewelry. Kāʻeokūlani was a ruler of northern Niʻihau 
            who unified the island after defeating his rival, a chief named Kawaihoa. A stone wall (<em>Pāpōhaku</em>) across a quarter 
            of the island's southern end marked the boundaries of the two chiefs: Kāʻeo's land was identified by black stones and 
            Kawaihoa's by white stones. Eventually, a great battle took place, known as Pali Kamakaui. Kāʻeo's two brothers from the 
            island of Maui, Kaiana and his half-brother Kahekili II, the King of Maui, fought for Kāʻeo, and Niʻihau was united under 
            his rule. Kawaihoa was banished to the south end of the island and Kāʻeo moved to the middle of the island to govern. Kāʻeo 
            married the Queen Kamakahelei, and a future king of Niʻihau and Kauaʻi named Kaumualiʻi was born in 1790. Kauaʻi and Niʻihau 
            are said to have carried the "highest blood lines" in the Hawaiian Islands.

            Kamehameha managed to unify all of the islands by 1795, except for Kauaʻi and Niʻihau: Two attempts to conquer those islands 
            had failed, and Kamehameha lost many men: bodies covered the beaches on Kauaʻi's eastern shores. Finally, in 1810, 
            Kamehameha amassed a great fleet, and Kaumualiʻi, the last independent aliʻi, surrendered rather than risk further bloodshed. 
            Independence again became feasible after Kamehameha's death in 1819, but was put down when Kamehameha's widow Kaʻahumanu 
            kidnapped Kaumualiʻi and forced him to marry her. Thereafter Niʻihau remained part of the unified Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

            Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair (1800–1892) purchased Niʻihau and parts of Kauaʻi from Kamehameha V in 1864 for $10,000 in 
            gold. Sinclair chose Niʻihau over other options, including Waikīkī and Pearl Harbor. By around 1875, Niʻihau's population 
            consisted of about 350 Native Hawaiians, with 20,000 sheep. This era marked the end of the art of Hawaiian mat-weaving 
            made famous by the people of Niʻihau. Makaloa (<em>Cyperus laevigatus</em>), a native sedge, used to grow on the edges of 
            Niʻihau's three intermittent lakes. The stems were harvested and used to weave moena makaloa (mats), considered the "finest 
            sleeping mats in Polynesia". The mats were valued by aliʻi and foreign visitors alike, but by the end of the 19th century, 
            Hawaiians had stopped weaving makaloa due to changes in population, culture, economics, and the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1915, Sinclair's grandson Aubrey Robinson closed the island to most visitors. Even relatives of the inhabitants could 
            visit only by special permission. Upon Aubrey's death in 1939 the island passed to his son Aylmer, and in 1968 to Aylmer's 
            youngest brother Lester. Upon Lester's wife Helen's death, the island passed to his sons Bruce Robinson and Keith Robinson, 
            the current co-owners.
        </p>

            Niʻihau played a small role during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In what has come to be called the "Niʻihau 
            Incident" (or the Battle of Niʻihau), a Japanese pilot whose Zero had been hit crash-landed on the island hoping to 
            rendezvous with a rescue submarine. The pilot was apprehended and later escaped with the assistance of local Japanese 
            residents, but he was killed shortly afterwards.

            Despite its self-imposed isolation, Niʻihau has a long-standing relationship with the U.S. military dating from 1924. There 
            is a small Navy installation on the island. No military personnel are permanently stationed there, but the U.S. military has 
            used the island for training special operations units, which included hiring Hawaiians who live on Niʻihau as "enemy" trackers.
